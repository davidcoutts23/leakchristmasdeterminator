# leak christmas determinator

A fortran program that determines whether the today is the Leak family annual christmas party in the year 2022

To compile and execute this amazing program
- To compile and run this program, you will need a Fortran compiler. If you are using a Unix-like operating system, you can use the gfortran compiler by typing the following command: `gfortran program.f90`
- This will create an executable file called a.out. You can then run the program by typing: `./a.out`

It would be silly to learn fortran for a gag christmas gift so chatGPT was used to write all the code
